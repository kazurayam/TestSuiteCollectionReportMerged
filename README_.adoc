= TestSuiteCollection Reports Collector

@date 29 Jan 2022

This is a Katalon Studio project where I developed a jar file `com.kazurayam.ks.reports.TestSuiteCollectionCollector-x.x.x.jar`.


This jar provides a Custom Keyword operational in any Katalon Studio project. It can display the total execution time of a Test Suite Collection executuion in seconds.


This Custom Keyword was developed to propose a solution to a question raised in the Katalon User Forum:

- https://forum.katalon.com/t/execution-start-end-date-time-and-duration-of-test-suite-collection/62027[Execution start end date time and duration of test suite collection]

This project was developed using Katalon Studio v8.2.0, but the Custom Keyword should run on any version.

== Problem to solve

Katalon Studio provides a feature called "Test Suite Collection". A Test Suite Collection is a collection of multiple Test Suites. You can execute the Test Suites as one batch by executing the Test Suite Collection. 

Let me present an example. I have a Katalon Studio project where I have 2 Test Suites: `TS1` and `TS2`. And I have a Test Suite Collection named `TSC`. When I ran `TSC`, it generated outputs in the `Reports` folder, as follows:

```
$ cd Reports
:~/tmp/TestSuiteCollectionReportsCollector/Reports (master *)
$ tree .
.

└── Self-healing
    └── broken-test-objects.json

8 directories, 18 files
```

In the `Reports/20220129_104341/TS1/20220129_104343/JUnit_Report.xml` file, you can find that `TS1` took 3.893 seconds.

In the `Reports/20220129_104341/TS2/20220129_104345/JUnit_Report.xml` file, you can find that `TS2` took 3.728 seconds.

But you can not find the duration of `TSC` (TS1 + TS2) at all. How can I get it?

== Solution

I have developed a Custom Keyword. It looks into the `Reports` folder, identify the latest Test Suite Execution (TSC for short), find the `JUnitReport.xml` files of the Test Suites executed in the TSC, calculate the duration of the TSC in seconds, display the duration in the console. For example

This would be useful if a TSC contains many Test Suites and each
